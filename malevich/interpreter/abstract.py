class Interpreter(Generic[State, Return]):
    """Base class for Interpreters

    An interpreter has an inner state, which is updated during the interpretation
    process. The state is updated by calling `update_state` method.

    The state is preserved in the history, which can be accessed by `history` property.
    Each time the state is updated, it is fully copied and appended to the history.

    The interpretation process can be divided into 5 steps:
    1. `before_interpret` - called before the interpretation process starts
    2. `create_node` - called when a new node is created
    3. `create_dependency` - called when a new dependency is created
    4. `after_interpret` - called after the interpretation process ends
    5. `get_result` - called to get the result of the interpretation process

    The base interpreter does not implement any of these steps. It is up to the
    child classes to implement them.

    But the base interpreter does implement the `interpret` method, which calls
    all the steps in the right order. It traverses the execution tree and calls
    the steps for each node and dependency. Traversing is preceeded by calling
    `before_interpret` and followed by calling `after_interpret`. The result of
    the interpretation process is returned by `get_result`.

    To implement a new interpreter, you need to inherit from this class and
    follow these guidelines:

    1.  Put any pipeline initialization logic into `before_interpret` method. For
        example intializiation of state, registry objects, establishing connections
        and so on.

    2.  The interpreter will traverse the execution tree and call `create_node` for
        each node and `create_dependency` for each dependency. The `create_node` method
        will be called twice for each node: first for the callee and then for the caller
        The `create_dependency` method will be called once for each dependency.

    3.  Put any pipeline finalization logic into `after_interpret` method. For example
        closing connections, saving state and so on.

    4. The result of the interpretation process is returned by `get_result` method.
        For example, you can return the state, or some part of it, or some other object.


    IMPORTANT: Ensure that the state is immutable. The state is copied and appended
    to the history each time it is updated. If the state is mutable, it will be
    changed in the history as well. This will lead to unexpected behavior.

    IMPORTANT: Ensure that ALL stages do return the state object if it is changed. The
    results of each stage are used as input for the next stage. If the state is not
    returned, the next stage will receive the old state.
